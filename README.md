This is the code repository for [Hands-On Deep Learning with Go](https://www.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-deep-learning-go?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=), published by Packt.

**A practical approach to building neural network models using Gorgonia.**

## What is this book about?
The Go ecosystem comprises some really powerful Deep Learning tools. This book shows you how to use these tools to train and deploy scalable Deep Learning models. You will explore a number of modern Neural Network architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, and more. By the end, you will be able to train your own Deep Learning models from scratch, using the power of Go.	

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Explore the Go ecosystem of libraries and communities for deep learning
* Get to grips with Neural Networks, their history, and how they work
* Design and implement Deep Neural Networks in Go
* Get a strong foundation of concepts such as Backpropagation and Momentum
* Build Variational Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines using Go
* Build models with CUDA and benchmark CPU and GPU models

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
type nn struct {
    g *ExprGraph
    w0, w1 *Node

    pred *Node
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for machine learning engineers, data analysts, data scientists interested in deep learning and are looking to explore implementing advanced algorithms in PyTorch. Some knowledge of machine learning is helpful but not a mandatory need. Working knowledge of Python programming is expected.
